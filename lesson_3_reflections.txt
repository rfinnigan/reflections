When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When it's important to have off-site backup
When collaborating with others over the web
When working on a project from multiple locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To have a more fine grained control over when pulls are made
To only pull necessary or interesting changes
To develop new experimental features on your local repo

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones-an exact copy made from a remote or local repositry to a local repo
Forks-an exact copy of a remote repositry made to another local repositry (basically a clone mad on github itself)
Branches-made within a local repositry, where you create an alternative version of the code that can later be combined back into the original version or discarded
