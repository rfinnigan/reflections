When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When it's important to have off-site backup
When collaborating with others over the web
When working on a project from multiple locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To have a more fine grained control over when pulls are made
To only pull necessary or interesting changes
To develop new experimental features on your local repo

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones-an exact copy made from a remote or local repositry to a local repo
Forks-an exact copy of a remote repositry made to another local repositry (basically a clone mad on github itself)
Branches-made within a local repositry, where you create an alternative version of the code that can later be combined back into the original version or discarded

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Allow you to work offline and compare to remote repo
Allow you to merge into remote repo then push that commit to github
Allow you to see differences between local and remote repo's

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
By sharing code on dropbox
By sending one another full copies of the code with only one person working on it at a time
There would be less chance of conflicts
There would be no easy way of merging or comparing conflicts
It would be harder to show each other ideas fir changes in the code without changing the main code
