When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When it's important to have off-site backup
When collaborating with others over the web
When working on a project from multiple locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To have a more fine grained control over when pulls are made
To only pull necessary or interesting changes
To develop new experimental features on your local repo
